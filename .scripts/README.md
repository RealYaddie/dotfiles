====== Group Assignment Outline ======
Created Friday 10 December 2021

==== Talk about the Project that you'll be covering ====
--------------------
This section is pretty self-explanatory I feel, but to expound on it a bit more(what i list below doesn't have everything):
	* What is the goal of the project, what is it going to do.
	* (Optional) Why was the Raspberry Pi used over the other many Single Board Computers (SBC) out there.
	* Give a rundown of how, the creator of the project goes about using the Raspberry Pi to accomplish the goal of their project.

==== Explaining the Technical Bits ====
--------------------
For this section I plan to cover what's going on behind the scenes for these projects. This includes:
	* The Physical hardware that is used together with the Raspberry Pi for the project.
	* Going over the code that is ran behind the scenes on the Raspberry Pi.
Since the plan is to ideally cover multiple Raspberry Pi Projects, it won't be possible to go into great detail for this section in either of the projects.

==== Demonstration Section ====
--------------------
This section would be the last before the end of the project coverage
	* End off with a little demo showing what the outcome was like (Like a video or some pictures showing the whole project working)
	* Also add a link so that interested persons can go and check out the full project, whether in the form of a video or a webpage that covers the project preferably from start to finish(maybe add this to both the PowerPoint & Word).

==== Honourable Mentions Section ====
--------------------
This section would be at the end of the entire powerpoint after all the projects, and this section will contain some other cool Raspberry Pi projects that were found online that were just as interesting, but we didn't think they needed to be covered in the same amount of detail as the projects that were presented on in this presentation.
