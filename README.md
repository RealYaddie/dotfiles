# Home to my dotfiles
___

Thought I would try using git to version control my dotfiles before I break something.

# TODO
___
- [ ] Tidy up the README file for this repository.
- [ ] Make a README for ~/scripts/ folder, that'll say what each script does and highlight any script that I think needs more info, whether that is in the form of Images,video etc.
- [ ] Go through and see exactly what files I need to actually keep backup here and what can be deleted.
